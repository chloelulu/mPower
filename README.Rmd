This package estimates the power for microbiome study design based on various experimental designs and parameters. For details of the proposed method, please refer to the following paper: Lu Yang, Jun Chen. mPower: A Real Data-based Power Analysis Tool for Microbiome Study Design

## 1. Usage
### 1.1 Package installation

You can install mPower as follows:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("chloelulu/mPower")
```

### 1.2 Shiny R App

You can also use our Shiny App without coding skills, please access the Shiny App at: https://microbiomestat.shinyapps.io/mPower/

## 2. Examples

Assume you are designing a case-control gut microbiome study (e.g., cancer vs healthy individuals) and want to determine the sample size needed to achieve 80% community-level and taxa-level power. Assume a log 2 fold change of 2 based on the literature.


```{r}
library(mPower)
data(feature.dat)
```

Preprocessing: exclude features present in fewer than 2 samples.
```{r}
feature.dat <- feature.dat[rowSums(feature.dat != 0) > 2, ]
```

Estimate the parameters
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model.paras <- EstPara(ref.otu.tab = feature.dat)
```

#### 2.1 Estimate Community-Level Power for Case-Control Study
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
res1 <- mPower(feature.dat = feature.dat, model.paras = model.paras,
               test = 'Community', design = 'CaseControl',
               nSams = 50, grp.ratio = 0.5,
               iters = 500, alpha = 0.05, distance = 'BC',
               diff.otu.pct = 0.1, diff.otu.direct = 'balanced',diff.otu.mode = 'random',
               covariate.eff.min = 0, covariate.eff.maxs = c(1, 2),
               confounder = 'no', depth.mu = 10000, depth.theta = 5, verbose = F)

```

##### 2.1.1 Output1: Community-level power table 

"power" column indicates community-level power: the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false. 
```{r echo=F, error=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=T, results="asis"}
knitr::kable(res1$power, format = "markdown", caption = "Community-Level Power Table")
```

##### 2.1.2 Output2: \( R^2 \) (variance explained) and community-level power curve

\( R^2 \) is generated from PERMANOVA, denotes the proportion of the total variation in the response data that is explained by the explanatory variables.
```{r echo=F,fig.height=6, fig.width=16}
res1$plot
```


#### 2.2 Estimate Taxa-Level Power for Case-Control Study
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
res2 <- mPower(feature.dat = feature.dat, model.paras = model.paras,
               test = 'Taxa', design = 'CaseControl',
               nSams = c(20, 80), grp.ratio = 0.5,
               iters = 50, alpha = 0.05, distance = 'BC',
               diff.otu.pct = 0.1, diff.otu.direct = 'balanced',diff.otu.mode = 'random',
               covariate.eff.min = 0, covariate.eff.maxs = 2,
               prev.filter = 0.1, max.abund.filter = 0.002,
               confounder = 'yes', depth.mu = 100000, depth.theta = 5, verbose = F)
```

##### 2.2.1 Output1: Taxa-level power table 

"pOCR" indicates the probability of making at least one correct rejection, meaning at least one taxon has a FDR-adjusted pvalue less than alpha(0.05).
```{r echo=F, error=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=T, results="asis"}
knitr::kable(res2$pOCR, format = "markdown", caption = "Taxa-Level Power Table")
```

##### 2.2.2 Output2: Taxa-level power table 

"aTPR" column indicates the average true positive rate. SD(Standard deviation) for each setting, i.e., sample size = 20 & max log2 fold change =2. ymax and ymin represents the upper and lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the aTPR.
```{r echo=F, error=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=T, results="asis"}
knitr::kable(res2$aTPR, format = "markdown", caption = "Taxa-Level Power Table")

```

##### 2.2.3 Output3: aTPR power curve(left) and pOCR power curve(right)

```{r echo=F,fig.height=6, fig.width=16}
res2$plot
```
